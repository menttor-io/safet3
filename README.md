# safet3

An API must be tested in **3** dimensions:
1. **Functionality**: Means that the API is working as expected before and after any change.
2. **Performance**: Means that the API is fast and can handle a lot of requests.
3. **Security**: Means that the API is secure and protected against attacks.

safet3 is a platform that helps you to test your API in these 3 dimensions.
